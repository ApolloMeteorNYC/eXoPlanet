#eXoPlanet

***eXoPlanet*** is a Meteor application for Meteor-NY meetup organizers to use to plan, arrange and manage events; and communicate with sponsors, members and other organizers. Using ***eXoPlanet,*** members can find out about planned events, examine and interact with artifacts from prior events, contribute to future events, and communicate with the organizers.

##Home

The *Home* page of an eXoPlanet deployment is meant to highlight the Meetup's mission; highlight any content that is topical; promote forthcoming events; solitic for members and presenter; point out who the organizers are; and showcase sponsor and vendor information as necessary.


##Sponsors

This page lists out the current and past sponsors (with sponsorship status: current one-time/current recurring/expired), providing their names and the type of sponsorship they provide. A link on each sponsor will generate a Sponsor Detail view. Sponsor details will include the number of events that have been sponsored to date; the date of first sponsorship (if known); and the sponsorship benefit to the members.

The page will also include an application form for sponsorship. Sponsors must be approved by organizers and confirmed by the administrators. The organizers should come up with a workflow that will ensure sponsorships are recognized in accordance with Meteor-NY's standards and practices.

##Vendors

Meteor-NY purchases services from vendors in both an ad hoc and recurring basis. The vendor section of the site is a way for the organizers to manage the workflow and expenses related to these services. Today, the two vendor types Meteor-NY works with are for food and video services. The vendors fill out a form that captures their information and provides login credentials to the vendor that provides them access to a special area in the application. In this area, the organizers and vendor customize an agreed-upon workflow that will ensure an operationally smooth experience setting up, delivering, and closing out an event. Ideally, each vendor type will match up with a templated workflow. In this way, when we change out a vendor, we can communicate our process on how we work without having to construct a unique workflow every time we change vendors.

##Events

Meteor-NY host four event types now:

1. Meteor Hack Night (monthly)
2. DevShop-NY (monthly)
3. Ladies' Hack Night (*monthly*)
4. **Special Events** (ad hoc)

The events section is the backbone of the application. It is here that organizers plan, schedule, and run events. Events tie in vendor and sponsor activities. It's the nerve center of the eXoPlanet implementation.

Different events require different workflows. In many cases, the cost for missing an event is negligible. However, for DevShop and special (conference-type) events, the reputational damage to the Meetup and the organizes can be substantial.
